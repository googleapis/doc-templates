Attributes:
    commit_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
        The time at which streams were committed in microseconds
        granularity. This field will only exist when there are no
        stream errors. <strong>Note</strong> if this field is not set, it means
        the commit was not successful.
    stream_errors (Sequence[google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1beta2.types.StorageError]):
        Stream level error if commit failed. Only
        streams with error will be in the list.
        If empty, there is no error and all streams are
        committed successfully. If non empty, certain
        streams have errors and ZERO stream is committed
        due to atomicity guarantee.</p>
