    summary: "`Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a\nURL that describes the type of the serialized message.\n\nProtobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form\nof utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.\n\nExample 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-rb\">Foo foo = ...;\nAny any;\nany.PackFrom(foo);\n...\nif (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {\n  ...\n}</pre>\n\nExample 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-rb\">Foo foo = ...;\nAny any = Any.pack(foo);\n...\nif (any.is(Foo.class)) {\n  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);\n}\n\n Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.\n\nfoo = Foo(...)\nany = Any()\nany.Pack(foo)\n...\nif any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):\n  any.Unpack(foo)\n  ...\n\n Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go\n\n foo := &pb.Foo{...}\n any, err := anypb.New(foo)\n if err != nil {\n   ...\n }\n ...\n foo := &pb.Foo{}\n if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {\n   ...\n }</pre>\n\nThe pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use\n'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack\nmethods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'\nin the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type\nname \"y.z\".\n\n\nJSON\n====\nThe JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular\nrepresentation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an\nadditional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-rb\">package google.profile;\nmessage Person {\n  string first_name = 1;\n  string last_name = 2;\n}\n\n{\n  \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n  \"firstName\": <string>,\n  \"lastName\": <string>\n}</pre>\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-rb\">{\n  \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n  \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n}</pre>"
