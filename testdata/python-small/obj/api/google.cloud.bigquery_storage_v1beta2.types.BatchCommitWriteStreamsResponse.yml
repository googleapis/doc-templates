  summary: "Response message for ``BatchCommitWriteStreams``.\n\n\nAttributes:\n \
    \   commit_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):\n        The time at\

    \ will only exist when there are no\n        stream errors. **Note** if this field\
    \ is not set, it means\n        the commit was not successful.\n    stream_errors\
    \ (Sequence[google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1beta2.types.StorageError]):\n    \
    \    Stream level error if commit failed. Only\n        streams with error will\
    \ be in the list.\n        If empty, there is no error and all streams are\n \
    \       committed successfully. If non empty, certain\n        streams have errors\
    \ and ZERO stream is committed\n        due to atomicity guarantee.\n"
